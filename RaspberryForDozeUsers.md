# Raspberry for Windows Users #

## Sharing a PC's Internet Connection ##

Not everybody has a full Ethernet home network. This section is for
those who have a Windows PC that connects to the Internet unwired, and
use an Ethernet cable to connect the Raspi with the PC.

  * http://morti12.blogspot.co.at/2012/08/network-connection-over-laptop-for.html. This is about setting up ICS on the PC, and checking that it works for the Raspi. You still need to be logged in to the Raspi via monitor and keyboard.

**TODO**:

  * Static IP on the Raspi so we can omit monitor and keyboard
  * VNC server (`apt-get install tightvncserver`, http://raspi.tv/tag/tightvnc-server-gui-on-raspberry-pi)
  * Text editor (not exactly a Windows problem, but has to be solved nevertheless)
